visibility,"More urgent tasks have to be easily accessible so head was nice. It was good to have the keys easily accessible but not always in my FoV.. Where I look, I'd look to what is more important, so having it easily accessible in my FoV is nice.. Same as above.. The UIs were a bit too large and would occupy too much space in the FoV, that's why no option was a 7.. nan. Key - I want it to be accessible, close to me, not necessarily in my field of view. 
Others - Same as trial before.. nan",Moving,5.5488

obstruction,"Keys were all together so I had access to it when I needed.. I did not want to be always looking at it, and not having it in my hand left my hands free to do the key task.. Same as above, but size was small so head was fine - would not obstruct the FoV too much. Hand anchor would be interesting but was obstructing my view too much (too big). nan. Key - Stay in front of me on top of the boxes 
Visual - Go to my belly level so you don't obstruct anything. Follow me.
Controls - Stay at my forehead level. Follow me.. nan",Semi-Stationary,2.8236
obstruction,"It was the main task so I could quickly see the key info and click on it.. Was able do distance it from the other task and would not obstruct my view when not uslng.. Body was more easily accessible and would not obstruct my view.. I thought body anchored would be best for all, but after trying others I thought it would be best to have the main task in a different zone than the others.. Grabbing the UIs, sometimes it was laggy.. Key Task go there to my left (would correct and guide with hand)
Would ask the others to go to the places I wish (go there, go here, etc).
Would also ask that I am always able to see them.. nan",Moving,1.9178
obstruction,"It was easier on the body because when I moved it would come with me and it wouldn't always obstruct my view.. I don't need to be always using my hand and it's nice to be able to see it only when I need.. It was small so it would not obstruct my FoV too much, therefore it was fine to have it head anchored. In the other places I'd have to think about it.. You plan something but then you end up doing something else while trying (that's what happened).. nan. Key - Put the key task by my belly. I want it to move with me.
Visual - Put by my hand in a neutral pose of the hand. I want it to move where my arm moves.

interaction,"It was hard to interact in torso so I did not quite like it. Head was always easy to reach and is stable to see the task (more intuitive than body). Arm was fine, but better for the controls, it would take too much space with keys task too (big UI).. In torso I could be doing my key task, while always being able to look at the visual task. Interacting was hard but for this task that did not matter. Head could also be fine but would polute my view and would only need to look occasionally.. Arm was easy to interact because the UI was very stable.. nan. Body was hard to interact. Even though I don't have XP with MR, using the system was intuitive.. Key - Assuming I could customize the UI, I'd ask to put the UI where I'm pointing, e.g., buttons here (pointing).
Visual - Put it in my body, use my hand to show the distance.
Controls - Put it my hand, below my physical hand.. Cool experience!!",Moving,4.893

convenience,"Used arm, but in retrospect, if I left the keys task in world it would have been more productive.. With body, the UI would be where I expect it to be without cluttering. And I just needed to look at this one.. Arm was functional, handy, and it was close.. nan. For this to work better, I'd create a ""screen"" with the 3 UIs, so they wouldn't separate.. Key - Go to the middle of the box.
Control - Stay here and more fixed (pointing to the arm).
Visual - Stay closer or further away. Do not move to much from the place I put it. Come with me.. nan",Semi-Stationary,2.2737
convenience,"It's fixed but mobile at the same time. It's easy to look at it without moving.. Because I only had to look at it, it was nice that I could look at it easily. Any zone where I could see it would be good, having it on the arm it wasn't always obstructing my view.. Similar to above. Accessible but I can hide it. It's not always in my FoV and I had the arm free.. nan. nan. I'd ask to fix them in specific points. E.g., fix in the arm, more to the left / right / far / close / up / down. For Key fix and follow my movement.. nan",Moving,1.9156
